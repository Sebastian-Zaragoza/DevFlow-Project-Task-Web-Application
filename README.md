## Overview
DevFlow is a comprehensive full-stack web application built to facilitate collaborative management of software development projects and tasks. It enables teams to create, edit, assign, and track projects and tasks efficiently, with a focus on security, scalability, and user-friendly interactions. The application features modular architecture, secure authentication mechanisms, and a responsive user interface, making it ideal for software development teams of any size.

**Note:** I'm actively engineering a custom AWS infrastructure to elevate the application, delivering unparalleled scalability, reliability, performance, and robustness to support growing demands and ensure a superior user experience. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting transition!

## Demo Views
Below are animated demos showcasing key features of the app. Each GIF demonstrates specific views and functionalities.

### Account View
This demo covers account creation, email confirmation using the link sent via email, password recovery, resending the confirmation email if the account is not yet confirmed, and logging in with credentials.

### Projects and Tasks View
This demo shows how to create, update, and delete projects. It also illustrates adding collaborators and their views, how role permissions (administrator vs. collaborator) influence actions, adding tasks and their behavior, adding notes, deleting items if you are the creator, viewing task details, and how the project updates itself automatically.

### Delete Project View
This demo explains how to delete a project, including system safeguards that invalidate the deletion if there are incomplete tasks or remaining collaborators.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main directories: the backend and the frontend. Below is the high-level directory structure:

```
DevFlow-Project-Task-Management/
â”œâ”€â”€ ProjectAndTaskManager-Backend/          # Backend application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/                                # Source code
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/                         # Configuration files (DB connection, CORS, email setup)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/                    # API controllers for auth, projects, and tasks
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ emails/                         # Email templates and utilities
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/                     # Middleware for authentication, validation, and error handling
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/                         # Mongoose models (User, Project, Task, Token)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/                         # API route definitions
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server.ts                       # Main server entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .env                                # Environment variables (use .env.example as template)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json                        # Dependencies and scripts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json                       # TypeScript configuration
â””â”€â”€ ProjectAndTaskManager-Frontend/         # Frontend application
    â”œâ”€â”€ src/                                # Source code
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/                            # API service wrappers (using Axios)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/                     # Reusable UI components
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/                          # Custom React hooks (e.g., for auth, data fetching)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/                        # Layout components (e.g., headers, footers)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ router.tsx                      # Routing configuration with React Router
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.tsx                        # Main application entry point
    â”œâ”€â”€ .env.local                          # Environment variables (use .env.local.example as template)
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.css                           # Global CSS styles (integrated with Tailwind)
    â””â”€â”€ vite.config.ts                      # Vite build configuration
```

This structure promotes separation of concerns, with the backend handling data persistence and business logic, and the frontend focusing on user interface and interactions.

## JWT Authentication Flow
1. **Registration/Login**: User submits credentials; backend validates and issues JWT access and refresh tokens.
2. **Token Usage**: Frontend stores tokens and includes access token in API requests.
3. **Refresh Mechanism**: If access token expires, refresh token is used to obtain a new one without re-login.
4. **Security Measures**: Tokens are stored securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookies for refresh tokens); endpoints are protected via middleware.

## Quick Start (Installation)
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- npm or yarn

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Sebastian-Zaragoza/DevFlow-Project-Task-Web-Application.git
   cd DevFlow-Project-Task-Web-Application
   ```

2. Set up the Backend:
   ```
   cd ProjectAndTaskManager-Backend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env  # Edit .env with your MongoDB URI, JWT secrets, email credentials, etc.
   npm run dev           # Starts the server (default port: 5000)
   ```

3. Set up the Frontend:
   ```
   cd ../ProjectAndTaskManager-Frontend
   npm install
   cp .env.local.example .env.local  # Edit with backend API URL (e.g., VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000)
   npm run dev                       # Starts the frontend (default port: 5173)
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the application.

## Usage
- **Register/Login**: Create an account or log in to access the dashboard.
- **Manage Projects**: From the dashboard, create new projects, add members, and view details.
- **Handle Tasks**: Within a project, add tasks, assign them, and update statuses.
- **API Interaction**: The frontend consumes the backend API; refer to `/routes/` for endpoint details.

For development, use `npm run dev` in both directories for hot-reloading.
